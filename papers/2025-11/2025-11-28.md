## Papers of Interest

### 1. Canvas-to-Image: Compositional Image Generation with Multimodal Controls

**Authors:** Yusuf Dalva, Guocheng Gordon Qian, Maya Goldenberg et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**arXiv ID:** 2511.21691v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21691v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
While modern diffusion models excel at generating high-quality and diverse images, they still struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control, particularly when users simultaneously specify text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotati...

### 2. TraceGen: World Modeling in 3D Trace Space Enables Learning from Cross-Embodiment Videos

**Authors:** Seungjae Lee, Yoonkyo Jung, Inkook Chun et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**arXiv ID:** 2511.21690v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21690v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Learning new robot tasks on new platforms and in new scenes from only a handful of demonstrations remains challenging. While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data...

### 3. ToolOrchestra: Elevating Intelligence via Efficient Model and Tool Orchestration

**Authors:** Hongjin Su, Shizhe Diao, Ximing Lu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**arXiv ID:** 2511.21689v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21689v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the u...

### 4. G$^2$VLM: Geometry Grounded Vision Language Model with Unified 3D Reconstruction and Spatial Reasoning

**Authors:** Wenbo Hu, Jingli Lin, Yilin Long et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**arXiv ID:** 2511.21688v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21688v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM,...

### 5. Matrix: Peer-to-Peer Multi-Agent Synthetic Data Generation Framework

**Authors:** Dong Wang, Yang Li, Ansong Ni et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**arXiv ID:** 2511.21686v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21686v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality...
