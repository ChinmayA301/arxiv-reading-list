### 1. Dark Energy Survey Year 3 results: Simulation-based $w$CDM inference
  from weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps with deep learning. I. Analysis
  design

**Authors:** A. Thomsen, J. Bucko, T. Kacprzak et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-06  
**arXiv ID:** 2511.04681v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04681v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Data-driven approaches using deep learning are emerging as powerful
techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale
structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI)
pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic
Dark...

### 2. GentleHumanoid: Learning Upper-body Compliance for Contact-rich Human
  and Object Interaction

**Authors:** Qingzhou Lu, Yao Feng, Baiyu Shi et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-06  
**arXiv ID:** 2511.04679v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04679v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where
safe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent
reinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress
external forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically
rest...

### 3. X-Diffusion: Training Diffusion Policies on Cross-Embodiment Human
  Demonstrations

**Authors:** Maximus A. Pace, Prithwish Dan, Chuanruo Ning et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-06  
**arXiv ID:** 2511.04671v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04671v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing
source of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ
fundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct
kinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce act...

### 4. Quantum Search With Generalized Wildcards

**Authors:** Arjan Cornelissen, Nikhil S. Mande, Subhasree Patro et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-06  
**arXiv ID:** 2511.04669v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04669v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
In the search with wildcards problem [Ambainis, Montanaro, Quantum
Inf.~Comput.'14], one's goal is to learn an unknown bit-string $x \in
\{-1,1\}^n$. An algorithm may, at unit cost, test equality of any subset of the
hidden string with a string of its choice. Ambainis and Montanaro showed a
quantum ...

### 5. Multi-Method Analysis of Mathematics Placement Assessments: Classical,
  Machine Learning, and Clustering Approaches

**Authors:** Julian D. Allagan, Dasia A. Singleton, Shanae N. Perry et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-06  
**arXiv ID:** 2511.04667v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04667v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered
to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory,
machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis
reveals that 55\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D ...
