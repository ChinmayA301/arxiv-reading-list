### 1. Changing Data Sources in the Age of Machine Learning for Official Statistics

**Authors:** Cedric De Boom, Michael Reusens  
**Published:** 2023-06-07  
**arXiv ID:** 2306.04338v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04338v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Data science has become increasingly essential for the production of official statistics, as it enables the automated collection, processing, and analysis of large amounts of data. With such data science practices in place, it enables more timely, more insightful and more flexible reporting. However...

### 3. Active learning for data streams: a survey

**Authors:** Davide Cacciarelli, Murat Kulahci  
**Published:** 2023-02-17  
**arXiv ID:** 2302.08893v4  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08893v4

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Online active learning is a paradigm in machine learning that aims to select the most informative data points to label from a data stream. The problem of minimizing the cost associated with collecting labeled observations has gained a lot of attention in recent years, particularly in real-world appl...

### 4. The Modern Mathematics of Deep Learning

**Authors:** Julius Berner, Philipp Grohs, Gitta Kutyniok et al.  
**Published:** 2021-05-09  
**arXiv ID:** 2105.04026v2  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04026v2

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We describe the new field of mathematical analysis of deep learning. This field emerged around a list of research questions that were not answered within the classical framework of learning theory. These questions concern: the outstanding generalization power of overparametrized neural networks, the...

### 5. Learning Curves for Decision Making in Supervised Machine Learning: A Survey

**Authors:** Felix Mohr, Jan N. van Rijn  
**Published:** 2022-01-28  
**arXiv ID:** 2201.12150v2  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12150v2

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Learning curves are a concept from social sciences that has been adopted in the context of machine learning to assess the performance of a learning algorithm with respect to a certain resource, e.g., the number of training examples or the number of training iterations. Learning curves have important...
