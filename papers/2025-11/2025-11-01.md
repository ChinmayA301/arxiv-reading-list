### 1. OmniX: From Unified Panoramic Generation and Perception to
  Graphics-Ready 3D Scenes

**Authors:** Yukun Huang, Jiwen Yu, Yanning Zhou et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-30  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.26800v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26800v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
th...

### 2. Masked Diffusion Captioning for Visual Feature Learning

**Authors:** Chao Feng, Zihao Wei, Andrew Owens  
**Published:** 2025-10-30  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.26799v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26799v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual feature...

### 3. SEE4D: Pose-Free 4D Generation via Auto-Regressive Video Inpainting

**Authors:** Dongyue Lu, Ao Liang, Tianxin Huang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-30  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.26796v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26796v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
...

### 4. Scaling Image Geo-Localization to Continent Level

**Authors:** Philipp Lindenberger, Paul-Edouard Sarlin, Jan Hosang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-30  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.26795v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26795v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
clas...

### 5. Learning Pseudorandom Numbers with Transformers: Permuted Congruential
  Generators, Curricula, and Interpretability

**Authors:** Tao Tao, Maissam Barkeshli  
**Published:** 2025-10-30  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.26792v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26792v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit...
