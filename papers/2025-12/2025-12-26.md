### 1. Optimizing Decoding Paths in Masked Diffusion Models by Quantifying Uncertainty

**Authors:** Ziyu Chen, Xinbei Jiang, Peng Sun et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.21336v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21336v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive ...

### 2. Autonomous Uncertainty Quantification for Computational Point-of-care Sensors

**Authors:** Artem Goncharov, Rajesh Ghosh, Hyou-Arm Joung et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.21335v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21335v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Computational point-of-care (POC) sensors enable rapid, low-cost, and accessible diagnostics in emergency, remote and resource-limited areas that lack access to centralized medical facilities. These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals ...

### 3. TICON: A Slide-Level Tile Contextualizer for Histopathology Representation Learning

**Authors:** Varun Belagali, Saarthak Kapse, Pierre Marza et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.21331v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21331v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
The interpretation of small tiles in large whole slide images (WSI) often needs a larger image context. We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-b...

### 4. Your Reasoning Benchmark May Not Test Reasoning: Revealing Perception Bottleneck in Abstract Reasoning Benchmarks

**Authors:** Xinhe Wang, Jin Huang, Xingjian Zhang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.21329v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21329v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Reasoning benchmarks such as the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) and ARC-AGI are widely used to assess progress in artificial intelligence and are often interpreted as probes of core, so-called ``fluid'' reasoning abilities. Despite their apparent simplicity for humans, these tasks remain cha...

### 5. Measuring all the noises of LLM Evals

**Authors:** Sida Wang  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.21326v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21326v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers ...
