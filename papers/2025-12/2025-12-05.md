### 1. The Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis

**Authors:** Prakhar Kaushik, Shravan Chaudhari, Ankit Vaidya et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-04  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.05117v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05117v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We show that deep neural networks trained across diverse tasks exhibit remarkably similar low-dimensional parametric subspaces. We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization...

### 2. Value Gradient Guidance for Flow Matching Alignment

**Authors:** Zhen Liu, Tim Z. Xiao, Carles Domingo-Enrich et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-04  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.05116v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05116v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
While methods exist for aligning flow matching models--a popular and effective class of generative models--with human preferences, existing approaches fail to achieve both adaptation efficiency and probabilistically sound prior preservation. In this work, we leverage the theory of optimal control an...

### 3. Deep infant brain segmentation from multi-contrast MRI

**Authors:** Malte Hoffmann, Lilla Zöllei, Adrian V. Dalca  
**Published:** 2025-12-04  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.05114v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05114v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Segmentation of magnetic resonance images (MRI) facilitates analysis of human brain development by delineating anatomical structures. However, in infants and young children, accurate segmentation is challenging due to development and imaging constraints. Pediatric brain MRI is notoriously difficult ...

### 4. DraCo: Draft as CoT for Text-to-Image Preview and Rare Concept Generation

**Authors:** Dongzhi Jiang, Renrui Zhang, Haodong Li et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-04  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.05112v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05112v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Recent unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for enhanced text-to-image generation. However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abst...

### 5. ARM-Thinker: Reinforcing Multimodal Generative Reward Models with Agentic Tool Use and Visual Reasoning

**Authors:** Shengyuan Ding, Xinyu Fang, Ziyu Liu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-04  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.05111v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05111v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Reward models are critical for aligning vision-language systems with human preferences, yet current approaches suffer from hallucination, weak visual grounding, and an inability to use tools for verification, limiting their reliability on complex multimodal reasoning tasks. We present ARM-Thinker, a...
