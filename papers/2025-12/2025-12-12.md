### 1. Omni-Attribute: Open-vocabulary Attribute Encoder for Visual Concept Personalization

**Authors:** Tsai-Shien Chen, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Guocheng Gordon Qian et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.10955v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10955v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Visual concept personalization aims to transfer only specific image attributes, such as identity, expression, lighting, and style, into unseen contexts. However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it diffi...

### 2. Bidirectional Normalizing Flow: From Data to Noise and Back

**Authors:** Yiyang Lu, Qiao Sun, Xianbang Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.10953v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10953v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Normalizing Flows (NFs) have been established as a principled framework for generative modeling. Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations ar...

### 3. Hierarchical Dataset Selection for High-Quality Data Sharing

**Authors:** Xiaona Zhou, Yingyan Zeng, Ran Jin et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.10952v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10952v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
The success of modern machine learning hinges on access to high-quality training data. In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Select...

### 4. Group Diffusion: Enhancing Image Generation by Unlocking Cross-Sample Collaboration

**Authors:** Sicheng Mo, Thao Nguyen, Richard Zhang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.10954v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10954v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
In this work, we explore an untapped signal in diffusion model inference. While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rathe...

### 5. E-RayZer: Self-supervised 3D Reconstruction as Spatial Visual Pre-training

**Authors:** Qitao Zhao, Hao Tan, Qianqian Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**arXiv ID:** 2512.10950v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10950v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Self-supervised pre-training has revolutionized foundation models for languages, individual 2D images and videos, but remains largely unexplored for learning 3D-aware representations from multi-view images. In this paper, we present E-RayZer, a self-supervised large 3D Vision model that learns truly...
