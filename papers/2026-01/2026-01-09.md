### 1. Mesh4D: 4D Mesh Reconstruction and Tracking from Monocular Video

**Authors:** Zeren Jiang, Chuanxia Zheng, Iro Laina et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.05251v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05251v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We propose Mesh4D, a feed-forward model for monocular 4D mesh reconstruction. Given a monocular video of a dynamic object, our model reconstructs the object's complete 3D shape and motion, represented as a deformation field. Our key contribution is a compact latent space that encodes the entire anim...

### 2. RL-AWB: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Auto White Balance Correction in Low-Light Night-time Scenes

**Authors:** Yuan-Kang Lee, Kuan-Lin Chen, Chia-Che Chang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.05249v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05249v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Nighttime color constancy remains a challenging problem in computational photography due to low-light noise and complex illumination conditions. We present RL-AWB, a novel framework combining statistical methods with deep reinforcement learning for nighttime white balance. Our method begins with a s...

### 3. QNeRF: Neural Radiance Fields on a Simulated Gate-Based Quantum Computer

**Authors:** Daniele Lizzio Bosco, Shuteng Wang, Giuseppe Serra et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.05250v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05250v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Recently, Quantum Visual Fields (QVFs) have shown promising improvements in model compactness and convergence speed for learning the provided 2D or 3D signals. Meanwhile, novel-view synthesis has seen major advances with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), where models learn a compact representation fro...

### 4. Optimal Lower Bounds for Online Multicalibration

**Authors:** Natalie Collina, Jiuyao Lu, Georgy Noarov et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.05245v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05245v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We prove tight lower bounds for online multicalibration, establishing an information-theoretic separation from marginal calibration.
  In the general setting where group functions can depend on both context and the learner's predictions, we prove an $Ω(T^{2/3})$ lower bound on expected multicalibrat...

### 5. Generate, Transfer, Adapt: Learning Functional Dexterous Grasping from a Single Human Demonstration

**Authors:** Xingyi He, Adhitya Polavaram, Yunhao Cao et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.05243v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05243v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Functional grasping with dexterous robotic hands is a key capability for enabling tool use and complex manipulation, yet progress has been constrained by two persistent bottlenecks: the scarcity of large-scale datasets and the absence of integrated semantic and geometric reasoning in learned models....
