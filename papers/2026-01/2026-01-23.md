### 1. CamPilot: Improving Camera Control in Video Diffusion Model with Efficient Camera Reward Feedback

**Authors:** Wenhang Ge, Guibao Shen, Jiawei Feng et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.16214v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16214v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Recent advances in camera-controlled video diffusion models have significantly improved video-camera alignment. However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowi...

### 2. Point Bridge: 3D Representations for Cross Domain Policy Learning

**Authors:** Siddhant Haldar, Lars Johannsmeier, Lerrel Pinto et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.16212v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16212v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Robot foundation models are beginning to deliver on the promise of generalist robotic agents, yet progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale real-world manipulation datasets. Simulation and synthetic data generation offer a scalable alternative, but their usefulness is limited by th...

### 3. Why Can't I Open My Drawer? Mitigating Object-Driven Shortcuts in Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition

**Authors:** Geo Ahn, Inwoong Lee, Taeoh Kim et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.16211v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16211v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We study Compositional Video Understanding (CVU), where models must recognize verbs and objects and compose them to generalize to unseen combinations. We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb...

### 4. PyraTok: Language-Aligned Pyramidal Tokenizer for Video Understanding and Generation

**Authors:** Onkar Susladkar, Tushar Prakash, Adheesh Juvekar et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.16210v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16210v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Discrete video VAEs underpin modern text-to-video generation and video understanding systems, yet existing tokenizers typically learn visual codebooks at a single scale with limited vocabularies and shallow language supervision, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and zero-shot transfer. We introd...

### 5. LLM-in-Sandbox Elicits General Agentic Intelligence

**Authors:** Daixuan Cheng, Shaohan Huang, Yuxian Gu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.16206v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16206v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We introduce LLM-in-Sandbox, enabling LLMs to explore within a code sandbox (i.e., a virtual computer), to elicit general intelligence in non-code domains. We first demonstrate that strong LLMs, without additional training, exhibit generalization capabilities to leverage the code sandbox for non-cod...
