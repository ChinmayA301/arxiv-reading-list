### 1. DInf-Grid: A Neural Differential Equation Solver with Differentiable Feature Grids

**Authors:** Navami Kairanda, Shanthika Naik, Marc Habermann et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.10715v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10715v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We present a novel differentiable grid-based representation for efficiently solving differential equations (DEs). Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based...

### 2. MatchTIR: Fine-Grained Supervision for Tool-Integrated Reasoning via Bipartite Matching

**Authors:** Changle Qu, Sunhao Dai, Hengyi Cai et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.10712v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10712v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) empowers large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks by interleaving reasoning steps with external tool interactions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all ...

### 3. From One-to-One to Many-to-Many: Dynamic Cross-Layer Injection for Deep Vision-Language Fusion

**Authors:** Cheng Chen, Yuyu Guo, Pengpeng Zeng et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.10710v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10710v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) create a severe visual feature bottleneck by using a crude, asymmetric connection that links only the output of the vision encoder to the input of the large language model (LLM). This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive ...

### 4. Euclid preparation. 3D reconstruction of the cosmic web with simulated Euclid Deep spectroscopic samples

**Authors:** Euclid Collaboration, K. Kraljic, C. Laigle et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.10709v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10709v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
The ongoing Euclid mission aims to measure spectroscopic redshifts for approximately two million galaxies using the H $α$ line emission detected in near-infrared slitless spectroscopic data from the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs). These measurements will reach a flux limit of $5\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm erg}...

### 5. High-accuracy and dimension-free sampling with diffusions

**Authors:** Khashayar Gatmiry, Sitan Chen, Adil Salim  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.10708v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10708v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Diffusion models have shown remarkable empirical success in sampling from rich multi-modal distributions. Their inference relies on numerically solving a certain differential equation. This differential equation cannot be solved in closed form, and its resolution via discretization typically require...
