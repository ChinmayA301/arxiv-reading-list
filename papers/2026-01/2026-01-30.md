## Papers of Interest

### 1. Discovering Hidden Gems in Model Repositories

**Authors:** Jonathan Kahana, Eliahu Horwitz, Yedid Hoshen  
**Published:** 2026-01-29  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.22157v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22157v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Public repositories host millions of fine-tuned models, yet community usage remains disproportionately concentrated on a small number of foundation checkpoints. We investigate whether this concentration reflects efficient market selection or if superior models are systematically overlooked. Through ...

### 2. Hybrid Linear Attention Done Right: Efficient Distillation and Effective Architectures for Extremely Long Contexts

**Authors:** Yingfa Chen, Zhen Leng Thai, Zihan Zhou et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-29  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.22156v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22156v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Hybrid Transformer architectures, which combine softmax attention blocks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown a desirable performance-throughput tradeoff for long-context modeling, but their adoption and studies are hindered by the prohibitive cost of large-scale pre-training from scratc...

### 3. Exploring Reasoning Reward Model for Agents

**Authors:** Kaixuan Fan, Kaituo Feng, Manyuan Zhang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-29  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.22154v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22154v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has achieved notable success in enabling agents to perform complex reasoning and tool use. However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to subop...

### 4. Late Breaking Results: Conversion of Neural Networks into Logic Flows for Edge Computing

**Authors:** Daniel Stein, Shaoyi Huang, Rolf Drechsler et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-29  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.22151v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22151v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Neural networks have been successfully applied in various resource-constrained edge devices, where usually central processing units (CPUs) instead of graphics processing units exist due to limited power availability. State-of-the-art research still focuses on efficiently executing enormous numbers o...

### 5. DynaWeb: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning of Web Agents

**Authors:** Hang Ding, Peidong Liu, Junqiao Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-29  
**arXiv ID:** 2601.22149v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22149v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
The development of autonomous web agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL), represents a significant step towards general-purpose AI assistants. However, training these agents is severely hampered by the challenges of interacting with the live internet, which i...
