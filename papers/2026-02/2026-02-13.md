### 1. Scaling Verification Can Be More Effective than Scaling Policy Learning for Vision-Language-Action Alignment

**Authors:** Jacky Kwok, Xilun Zhang, Mengdi Xu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.12281v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12281v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this...

### 2. UniT: Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Test-time Scaling

**Authors:** Leon Liangyu Chen, Haoyu Ma, Zhipeng Fan et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.12279v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12279v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, o...

### 3. Function-Space Decoupled Diffusion for Forward and Inverse Modeling in Carbon Capture and Storage

**Authors:** Xin Ju, Jiachen Yao, Anima Anandkumar et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.12274v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12274v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Accurate characterization of subsurface flow is critical for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) but remains challenged by the ill-posed nature of inverse problems with sparse observations. We present Fun-DDPS, a generative framework that combines function-space diffusion models with differentiable neu...

### 4. Learning to Control: The iUzawa-Net for Nonsmooth Optimal Control of Linear PDEs

**Authors:** Yongcun Song, Xiaoming Yuan, Hangrui Yue et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.12273v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12273v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We propose an optimization-informed deep neural network approach, named iUzawa-Net, aiming for the first solver that enables real-time solutions for a class of nonsmooth optimal control problems of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). The iUzawa-Net unrolls an inexact Uzawa method for saddl...

### 5. MonarchRT: Efficient Attention for Real-Time Video Generation

**Authors:** Krish Agarwal, Zhuoming Chen, Cheng Luo et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.12271v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12271v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers is bottlenecked by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in real-time regimes that are both few-step and autoregressive, where errors compound across time and each denoising step must carry substantially more information. In this s...
