### 1. Shared LoRA Subspaces for almost Strict Continual Learning

**Authors:** Prakhar Kaushik, Ankit Vaidya, Shravan Chaudhari et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.06043v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06043v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands...

### 2. Pseudo-Invertible Neural Networks

**Authors:** Yamit Ehrlich, Nimrod Berman, Assaf Shocher  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.06042v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06042v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
The Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse (PInv) serves as the fundamental solution for linear systems. In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of PInv to the nonlinear regime in general and to neural networks in particular. We introduce Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN), a class...

### 3. CommCP: Efficient Multi-Agent Coordination via LLM-Based Communication with Conformal Prediction

**Authors:** Xiaopan Zhang, Zejin Wang, Zhixu Li et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.06038v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06038v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
To complete assignments provided by humans in natural language, robots must interpret commands, generate and answer relevant questions for scene understanding, and manipulate target objects. Real-world deployments often require multiple heterogeneous robots with different manipulation capabilities t...

### 4. InterPrior: Scaling Generative Control for Physics-Based Human-Object Interactions

**Authors:** Sirui Xu, Samuel Schulter, Morteza Ziyadi et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.06035v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06035v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors ...

### 5. V-Retrver: Evidence-Driven Agentic Reasoning for Universal Multimodal Retrieval

**Authors:** Dongyang Chen, Chaoyang Wang, Dezhao SU et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.06034v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06034v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently been applied to universal multimodal retrieval, where Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves candidate reranking. However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to activ...
