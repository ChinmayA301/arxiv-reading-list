### 1. MediX-R1: Open Ended Medical Reinforcement Learning

**Authors:** Sahal Shaji Mullappilly, Mohammed Irfan Kurpath, Omair Mohamed et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.23363v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23363v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We introduce MediX-R1, an open-ended Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that enables clinically grounded, free-form answers beyond multiple-choice formats. MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a compos...

### 2. Model Agreement via Anchoring

**Authors:** Eric Eaton, Surbhi Goel, Marcel Hussing et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.23360v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23360v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Numerous lines of aim to control $\textit{model disagreement}$ -- the extent to which two machine learning models disagree in their predictions. We adopt a simple and standard notion of model disagreement in real-valued prediction problems, namely the expected squared difference in predictions betwe...

### 3. A Dataset is Worth 1 MB

**Authors:** Elad Kimchi Shoshani, Leeyam Gabay, Yedid Hoshen  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.23358v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23358v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
A dataset server must often distribute the same large payload to many clients, incurring massive communication costs. Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their ow...

### 4. SOTAlign: Semi-Supervised Alignment of Unimodal Vision and Language Models via Optimal Transport

**Authors:** Simon Roschmann, Paul Krzakala, Sonia Mazelet et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.23353v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23353v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that neural networks trained on different modalities converge toward a shared statistical model of the world. Recent work exploits this convergence by aligning frozen pretrained vision and language models with lightweight alignment layers, but typically ...

### 5. FlashOptim: Optimizers for Memory Efficient Training

**Authors:** Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz, Abhay Gupta, Chris Renard et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**arXiv ID:** 2602.23349v1  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23349v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Standard mixed-precision training of neural networks requires many bytes of accelerator memory for each model parameter. These bytes reflect not just the parameter itself, but also its gradient and one or more optimizer state variables. With each of these values typically requiring 4 bytes, training...
