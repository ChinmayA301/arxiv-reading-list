### 1. Towards General Modality Translation with Contrastive and Predictive
  Latent Diffusion Bridge

**Authors:** Nimrod Berman, Omkar Joglekar, Eitan Kosman et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.20819v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20819v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translati...

### 2. VAMOS: A Hierarchical Vision-Language-Action Model for
  Capability-Modulated and Steerable Navigation

**Authors:** Mateo Guaman Castro, Sidharth Rajagopal, Daniel Gorbatov et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.20818v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20818v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
A fundamental challenge in robot navigation lies in learning policies that
generalize across diverse environments while conforming to the unique physical
constraints and capabilities of a specific embodiment (e.g., quadrupeds can
walk up stairs, but rovers cannot). We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical V...

### 3. KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning is Designed to Mode Collapse

**Authors:** Anthony GX-Chen, Jatin Prakash, Jeff Guo et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.20817v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20817v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition ...

### 4. GSWorld: Closed-Loop Photo-Realistic Simulation Suite for Robotic
  Manipulation

**Authors:** Guangqi Jiang, Haoran Chang, Ri-Zhao Qiu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.20813v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20813v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics
manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our
framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with
reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data an...

### 5. SpectraMorph: Structured Latent Learning for Self-Supervised
  Hyperspectral Super-Resolution

**Authors:** Ritik Shah, Marco F Duarte  
**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.20814v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20814v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super...
