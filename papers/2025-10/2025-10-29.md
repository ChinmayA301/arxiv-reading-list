## Papers of Interest

### 1. Generative View Stitching

**Authors:** Chonghyuk Song, Michal Stary, Boyuan Chen et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-28  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.24718v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24718v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to colli...

### 2. Machine-Learning-Assisted Comparison of Regression Functions

**Authors:** Jian Yan, Zhuoxi Li, Yang Ning et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-28  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.24714v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24714v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We revisit the classical problem of comparing regression functions, a
fundamental question in statistical inference with broad relevance to modern
applications such as data integration, transfer learning, and causal inference.
Existing approaches typically rely on smoothing techniques and are thus
h...

### 3. A Single-Loop First-Order Algorithm for Linearly Constrained Bilevel
  Optimization

**Authors:** Wei Shen, Jiawei Zhang, Minhui Huang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-28  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.24710v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24710v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We study bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level problems are
strongly convex and have coupled linear constraints. To overcome the potential
non-smoothness of the hyper-objective and the computational challenges
associated with the Hessian matrix, we utilize penalty and augmented Lagrang...

### 4. Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision
  Transformers?

**Authors:** Yihao Li, Saeed Salehi, Lyle Ungar et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-28  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.24709v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, an...

### 5. Cluster Dose Prediction in Carbon Ion Therapy: Using Transfer Learning
  from a Pretrained Dose Prediction U-Net

**Authors:** Miriam Schwarze, Hui Khee Looe, BjÃ¶rn Poppe et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-28  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.24703v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24703v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
The cluster dose concept offers an alternative to the radiobiological
effectiveness (RBE)-based model for describing radiation-induced biological
effects. This study examines the application of a neural network to predict
cluster dose distributions, with the goal of replacing the computationally
int...
