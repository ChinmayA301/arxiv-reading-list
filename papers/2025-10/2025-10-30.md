### 1. VFXMaster: Unlocking Dynamic Visual Effect Generation via In-Context
  Learning

**Authors:** Baolu Li, Yiming Zhang, Qinghe Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-29  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.25772v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25772v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thu...

### 2. E-Scores for (In)Correctness Assessment of Generative Model Outputs

**Authors:** Guneet S. Dhillon, Javier GonzÃ¡lez, Teodora Pandeva et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-29  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.25770v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25770v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
While generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), are
ubiquitous in today's world, principled mechanisms to assess their
(in)correctness are limited. Using the conformal prediction framework, previous
works construct sets of LLM responses where the probability of including an
incorre...

### 3. Neural Stochastic Flows: Solver-Free Modelling and Inference for SDE
  Solutions

**Authors:** Naoki Kiyohara, Edward Johns, Yingzhen Li  
**Published:** 2025-10-29  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.25769v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25769v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs...

### 4. Multimodal Spatial Reasoning in the Large Model Era: A Survey and
  Benchmarks

**Authors:** Xu Zheng, Zihao Dongfang, Lutao Jiang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-29  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.25760v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25760v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However...

### 5. Synthetic Data Reveals Generalization Gaps in Correlated Multiple
  Instance Learning

**Authors:** Ethan Harvey, Dennis Johan Loevlie, Michael C. Hughes  
**Published:** 2025-10-29  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.25759v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25759v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of near...
