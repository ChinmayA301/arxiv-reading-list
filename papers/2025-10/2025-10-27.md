### 1. Connecting Chemical Enrichment with Resolved Star Formation Histories

**Authors:** Christopher T. Garling, Alex M. Garcia, Niusha Ahvazi et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-24  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.21707v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21707v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We present a new framework for modeling the chemical enrichment histories of
galaxies by integrating the chemical evolution with resolved star formation
histories (SFHs) derived from color-magnitude diagrams. This novel approach
links the time evolution of the metallicity of the star-forming ISM to ...

### 2. Equivariance by Contrast: Identifiable Equivariant Embeddings from
  Unlabeled Finite Group Actions

**Authors:** Tobias Schmidt, Steffen Schneider, Matthias Bethge  
**Published:** 2025-10-24  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.21706v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21706v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
inv...

### 3. Visual Diffusion Models are Geometric Solvers

**Authors:** Nir Goren, Shai Yehezkel, Omer Dahary et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-24  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.21697v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21697v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curv...

### 4. Mechanistic Interpretability for Neural TSP Solvers

**Authors:** Reuben Narad, Leonard Boussioux, Michael Wagner  
**Published:** 2025-10-24  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.21693v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21693v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristi...

### 5. On Uncertainty Calibration for Equivariant Functions

**Authors:** Edward Berman, Jacob Ginesin, Marco Pacini et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-24  
**arXiv ID:** 2510.21691v1  
**Link:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21691v1

**Abstract (excerpt):**  
Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation ca...
